Factlink is committed to decentralization not just in technology, but also in decision making. Our governance model empowers the community to shape the future of the protocol.

## Community Proposals

Anyone can submit proposals for protocol upgrades, new features, or ecosystem initiatives. Proposals are discussed openly and transparently.

## Voting Mechanism

Token holders can vote on proposals using a secure, on-chain voting system. This ensures that all voices are heard and that decisions reflect the will of the community.

## Transparency and Accountability

All governance actions are recorded on-chain, providing full transparency. Factlink's governance process is designed to be fair, open, and resistant to manipulation.

## The Road Ahead

As Factlink grows, governance will continue to evolve, ensuring that the protocol remains responsive to the needs of its users and stakeholders.
