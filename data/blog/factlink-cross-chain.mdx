The future of DeFi is multi-chain. Factlink is building the infrastructure to connect disparate blockchains, enabling assets and data to flow freely across ecosystems.

## Why Cross-Chain Matters

No single blockchain can meet all the needs of the DeFi world. Interoperability is essential for liquidity, innovation, and user choice.

## Factlink's Approach

- **Bridges:** Secure, audited bridges connect Factlink to major blockchains.
- **Unified Oracles:** Factlink oracles aggregate data from multiple chains for consistent, reliable feeds.
- **Asset Transfers:** Move tokens and data seamlessly between networks.

## Use Cases

- Arbitrage and trading across DEXs
- Cross-chain prediction markets
- Multi-chain governance and DAOs

## Looking Forward

Factlink is committed to a future where DeFi is open, connected, and borderless. Our cross-chain solutions are a key step toward that vision.
